## ✅ Analysis and Key Learnings

### 🔎 Observations:
- Simple passwords like hello123 can be cracked in seconds.
- Adding uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols improves strength significantly.
- Longer passwords (16+ characters) provide much greater security and resistance to brute-force attacks.

### 🛡 Best Practices:
- Use passwords with at least 12–16 characters.
- Include a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid common dictionary words and personal information.
- Use passphrases (e.g., Sky!Runs#Fast2025) for memorability + strength.
- Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely.
